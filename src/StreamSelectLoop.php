/**
 * A `stream_select()` based event loop.
 *
 * This uses the [`stream_select()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-select.php)
 * function and is the only implementation which works out of the box with PHP.
 *
 * This event loop works out of the box on PHP 5.4 through PHP 7+ and HHVM.
 * This means that no installation is required and this library works on all
 * platforms and supported PHP versions.
 * Accordingly, the [`Factory`](#factory) will use this event loop by default if
 * you do not install any of the event loop extensions listed below.
 *
 * Under the hood, it does a simple `select` system call.
 * This system call is limited to the maximum file descriptor number of
 * `FD_SETSIZE` (platform dependent, commonly 1024) and scales with `O(m)`
 * (`m` being the maximum file descriptor number passed).
 * This means that you may run into issues when handling thousands of streams
 * concurrently and you may want to look into using one of the alternative
 * event loop implementations listed below in this case.
 * If your use case is among the many common use cases that involve handling only
 * dozens or a few hundred streams at once, then this event loop implementation
 * performs really well.
 *
 * If you want to use signal handling (see also [`addSignal()`](#addsignal) below),
 * this event loop implementation requires `ext-pcntl`.
 * This extension is only available for Unix-like platforms and does not support
 * Windows.
 * It is commonly installed as part of many PHP distributions.
 * If this extension is missing (or you're running on Windows), signal handling is
 * not supported and throws a `BadMethodCallException` instead.
 *
 * This event loop is known to rely on wall-clock time to schedule future
 * timers, because a monotonic time source is not available in PHP by default.
 * While this does not affect many common use cases, this is an important
 * distinction for programs that rely on a high time precision or on systems
 * that are subject to discontinuous time adjustments (time jumps).
 * This means that if you schedule a timer to trigger in 30s and then adjust
 * your system time forward by 20s, the timer may trigger in 10s.
 * See also [`addTimer()`](#addtimer) for more details.
